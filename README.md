Firstly dr.priya darshani ji taught a expert lecture on universal human values

Universal human values are principles and ideals that are generally accepted and respected by people across different cultures, religions, and backgrounds. They are seen as the foundation for a humane and civilized society. These values are thought to stem from an innate human conscience and reason, rather than being imposed by any specific authority or institution.
