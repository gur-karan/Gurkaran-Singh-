Then second lecture by Dr Randhir Singh on conduct examination He said that the Conducting an examination refers to the process of administering a formal test or assessment. This includes all the steps and procedures taken to ensure the exam is fair, secure, and properly managed.
Key Aspects of an Examination's Conduct
Preparation: This involves creating the exam paper, establishing the exam schedule and seating arrangements, and ensuring all necessary materials (such as answer sheets and question booklets) are ready.
Administration: During the exam, invigilators or proctors are responsible for maintaining order, preventing cheating, and enforcing the rules. They ensure that students have the correct materials, are seated in their assigned places, and follow the guidelines for things like permitted calculators or scratch paper.
Security: This is a critical component and includes measures to prevent question papers from being leaked beforehand and to ensure the integrity of answer scripts after the exam is over.
Rules and Regulations: A code of conduct is typically in place, which outlines what students are and aren't allowed to do. Violations, such as using unauthorized materials or communicating with other students, can lead to disciplinary action.
Technology: With the rise of online learning, many examinations are now conducted using specialized software. These platforms provide a secure environment for students to take tests, often with features to monitor activity and prevent academic misconduct.
In essence, the conduct of an examination is about the effective and fair execution of a test from start to finish.

Then third lecture by Dr priya darshni Madam on universal human values 2 she said that "Universal Human Values 2" (UHV 2) is a mandatory foundation course in many Indian technical and professional colleges, often following an introductory course (UHV 1). The curriculum is designed to help students develop a holistic perspective on life and their profession. It focuses on self-exploration and understanding the harmony that exists at various levels of human existence.
Here's a breakdown of the typical course content and objectives:
Core Concepts
The course is structured around the idea of "co-existence" and "harmony" and is often divided into several modules:
Understanding the Human Being: This module delves into the distinction between the "self" (I) and the "body." It explores the different needs of each—happiness for the self and physical facilities for the body—and the relationship between them. The goal is for students to understand themselves better through a process of self-exploration.
Harmony in the Family and Society: This part of the course focuses on human relationships. It proposes a set of nine universal values essential for building and maintaining relationships, with a strong emphasis on trust and respect as foundational. It examines the meaning of justice and the vision for a harmonious, undivided society.
Harmony in Nature/Existence: Students explore the interconnectedness and mutual fulfillment among the four orders of nature (material, plant, animal, and human). The curriculum emphasizes the idea of existence as a state of co-existence and the role of humans in ensuring harmony with the natural world.
Professional Ethics: The course concludes by applying these concepts to the professional world. It addresses how to use a holistic understanding of human values to define ethical human conduct and build a humane professional order. The focus is on using one's professional competence to contribute to a universal human order.
Course Objectives
The main objectives of UHV 2 are to help students:
Develop a Holistic Perspective: To see the essential complementarity between "values" and "skills" in achieving sustained happiness and prosperity.
Strengthen Self-Reflection: To engage in a process of self-exploration, verifying proposals about reality based on their own "natural acceptance" and experiential validation.
Become Socially and Environmentally Responsible: To become more aware of their surroundings and their commitment to sustainable solutions, while keeping human relationships and nature in mind.
Cultivate a Commitment to Action: To develop the courage and commitment to act on their understanding and live in accordance with these values.
The course is typically taught through interactive discussions and practice sessions rather than a set of sermons or dogmatic rules. The goal is to facilitate a change in the student's worldview, moving beyond mere information transfer to a more qualitative transformation in their consciousness.

First lecture by Mr.Dr.Gautam murri D-4 ME on Motor sport he said Motorsport, also known as motor sport, is a broad term for a group of competitive events that primarily involve the use of motorized vehicles. It encompasses a wide variety of disciplines, from high-speed racing on purpose-built circuits to off-road challenges and precision driving and then said its history that,The origins of motorsport can be traced back to the late 19th century. One of the first recognized competitive events was a "horseless carriage" contest organized by a French newspaper in 1894, featuring a road race from Paris to Rouen. Early motorsport was a way to showcase the capabilities of new automobiles. Over time, the sport became more organized, with the first Grand Prix race held in 1906 and the establishment of governing bodies to regulate competitions. Then,
Types of Motorsport
Motorsport is incredibly diverse and can be categorized in several ways, including by the type of vehicle used, the terrain, or the competition format. Some of the most popular types include:
Open-Wheel Racing: This is a class of racing where the wheels are not enclosed by the bodywork. The cars are typically purpose-built for racing. The most famous example is Formula 1 (F1), the highest class of single-seater auto racing in the world. Other examples include IndyCar and Formula E (for electric cars).
Sports Car Racing: This involves racing with production-based grand touring (GT) cars and racing prototypes. Endurance racing, like the 24 Hours of Le Mans, is a key part of this category, testing the limits of a car's and a driver's stamina over long periods.
Stock Car Racing: Originally, this used "stock" production cars. Today, the vehicles are highly modified but maintain the silhouette of a production car. NASCAR is the most prominent series in this category, particularly in the United States.
Rallying: This is a form of racing on public or private roads with modified production or specially built cars. Competitors race between set checkpoints, often on challenging and unpaved terrain. The World Rally Championship (WRC) and the Dakar Rally are well-known examples.
Motorcycle Racing: This includes various disciplines like MotoGP (the motorcycle equivalent of F1), motocross (off-road racing on rugged tracks), and Superbike World Championship. 
Then,
Major Motorsport Events
Some of the most iconic and prestigious events in motorsport are:
Formula 1 Grand Prix: A series of races held worldwide, with the Monaco Grand Prix being a famous street circuit race.
Indianapolis 500: An annual oval-track race in the United States, considered one of the three legs of the "Triple Crown of Motorsport" (along with the Monaco Grand Prix and 24 Hours of Le Mans).
24 Hours of Le Mans: An endurance race in France, where teams of drivers push their cars to the limit for a full 24 hours.
Daytona 500: The most prestigious race in the NASCAR calendar, often kicking off the season.
And at the end,
Governing Bodies
Several international organizations oversee and govern motorsport competitions:
Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA): The main governing body for four-wheeled motorsport worldwide, including Formula 1, the World Rally Championship, and Formula E.
